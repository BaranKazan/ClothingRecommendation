# Instructions


Hello,

I have implemented Swagger into the project to make it easier for making REST API calls. 
The Swagger UI can be accessed locally at the following URL when the application is running:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

Thanks for letting me doing this assignment, it was fun and a great learning experience.

Sincerely,

Baran Kazan
